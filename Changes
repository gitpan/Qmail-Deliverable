Revision history for Perl extension Qmail::Deliverable.

1.01
        - qpsmtpd plugin check_qmail_deliverable installs as a binary, so
          that it has a manpage. If you execute it, you get installation
          instructions.
        - $Qmail::Deliverable::Client::SERVER can be a callback now
        - Plugin now uses the callback option for cleaner code
        - Plugin now allows hostnames instead of IP adresses only
        - Exclusions now enabled for smtproutes
        - ::Client::qmail_local no longer returns undef on connection error,
          because undef already meant something else
        - qmail-deliverabled has basic statistics in $0
        - minor documentation updates
