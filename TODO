My wishes for future versions:

- Put plugin or smtproutes functionality in a module
- Put status descriptions in a module
- Provide more detailed info for what's now just 0x00
- Write a qmail-spp plugin
- Change the qpsmtpd plugin to a module based plugin
- Use real daemonization instead of fork && exit
- Write a test suite; is this even possible?
